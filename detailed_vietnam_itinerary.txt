Family Trip Context: two parents and two children (ages 12 and 15) are traveling through Vietnam from 26 March to 12 April 2025.  Flights in and out of Hanoi book-end the journey; three short domestic flights (Hanoi → Da Nang, Da Nang → Phú Quốc, Phú Quốc → Hanoi) keep over-land travel light.  The goal is a balanced blend of city life, scenery, soft adventure, and beaches that rival Thailand's, all while avoiding night buses or marathon drives.

Day 1 · Wednesday 26 March — Arrival in Hanoi
By late afternoon the family clears immigration at Nội Bài, meets a pre-arranged driver, and reaches a boutique hotel tucked inside Hanoi's Old Quarter.  Evening brings first tastes and sights: steam rises from bowls of aromatic phở, the red Huc Bridge glows across Hoàn Kiếm Lake, and motorbikes stream past as the family strolls the lantern-lit shoreline.


Day 2 · Thursday 27 March — Hanoi's Historic Core
After breakfast the day opens at the serene Temple of Literature, Vietnam's first university, with its courtyards and stone tortoises.  A short ride away, the War Remnants exhibits spark questions from the 15-year-old while younger sibling enjoys climbing through vintage aircraft outside.  Lunch is bun cha—charcoal-grilled pork over vermicelli—before a guided street-food walk threads tiny alleys, introducing egg coffee and bamboo-sticky-rice treats.  The sun dips and the family watches a traditional water-puppet theater performance on a stage that floats atop a pond.


Day 3 · Friday 28 March — Bat Trang Pottery & Dong Xuan Market
A forty-five-minute drive follows the Red River to Bat Trang village where the children try the potter's wheel, shaping clay bowls and decorating them with cobalt glaze.  Back in the city the afternoon is spent wandering Dong Xuan Market, its aisles stacked with spices, dried fruit, and colorful fabrics.  In the evening tickets and final paperwork for tomorrow's Ninh Binh excursion and the upcoming Ha Long cruise are confirmed.


Day 4 · Saturday 29 March — Ninh Binh: "Ha Long Bay on Land"
A dawn start carries the family two hours south to Tam Cốc, a valley of emerald rice paddies squeezed between limestone cliffs.  Women row flat-bottom sampans with their feet, guiding the boat under cave arches while waterbirds skim the surface.  After the ride, bicycles await for a gentle pedal through rice fields to Múa Cave; 450 stone steps lead to a dragon-topped summit and a panoramic view.  Late afternoon they return to Hanoi for dinner and rest.


Day 5 · Sunday 30 March — Boarding a Ha Long Bay Junk
A mid-morning shuttle winds east to Tuan Chau pier where a traditional wooden junk boat welcomes guests with lotus-flower drinks.  After check-in the vessel threads between towering green islets; kayaking into hidden lagoons and exploring Luon Cave fills the afternoon.  Night falls over calm water, squid fishing lines glimmer off the stern, and distant cliffs silhouette under starlight.


Day 6 · Monday 31 March — From Emerald Bay to Lantern Town
Tai-chi on deck at sunrise precedes a light brunch as the junk glides back to harbor.  The shuttle returns to Hanoi in early afternoon, just in time for a short flight south to Da Nang.  A forty-five-minute car ride delivers the family to Hội An where the Thu Bồn River flickers with floating candles and every doorway glows with silk lanterns.

Day 7 · Tuesday 1 April — Beach and Coconut-Forest Fun
Morning is pure leisure on An Bàng Beach: soft sand, gentle waves, chilled coconuts.  After lunch a guide leads the family into Cam Thanh's nipa-palm channels; each climbs into a round bamboo basket boat that spins playfully while fishermen sing folk songs.  Evening markets serve sweet rice pancakes and coconut ice cream beneath lantern canopies.


Day 8 · Wednesday 2 April — Cooking Class and Marble Mountains
A chef escorts everyone through Hội An's wet market, buying herbs, morning-glory greens, and fresh rice noodles.  Back at the cooking school they pound lemongrass, stir-fry cao lầu, and craft crispy spring rolls.  Later a short ride south leads to Marble Mountains; stone steps ascend through pagodas and natural caves lit by shafts of afternoon sun.


Day 9 · Thursday 3 April — Tailors and Poolside Downtime
The day is easy by design: morning visits to famous Hội An tailors for measurements and fabric choices, followed by an afternoon at the hotel pool and an evening photo stroll along lantern-lined streets.


Day 10 · Friday 4 April — Mỹ Sơn Sanctuary
An early minivan heads west to the jungle-wrapped ruins of Mỹ Sơn where red-brick Cham temples stand in misty glades.  A traditional Cham dance performance adds rhythm before the family returns to Hội An for a sunset swim and night-market snacks.


Day 11 · Saturday 5 April — Hải Vân Pass Rail and Imperial Huế
Windows frame sea cliffs as the Reunification Railway chugs over the Hải Vân ridge toward Huế.  A local guide meets the train, leading through the vast Imperial Citadel, onto dragon boats across the Perfume River, and out to Emperor Tự Đức's lakeside tombs.  Evening sees the same coastal rail line return the family to the comfort of their Hội An hotel.


Day 12 · Sunday 6 April — Flight to Phú Quốc Island
Morning taxi to Da Nang airport precedes a ninety-minute hop to Phú Quốc.  By early afternoon everyone is settled in a beachfront resort on Long Beach, watching the sun melt into the Gulf of Thailand while fishing boats sparkle on the horizon.


Day 13 · Monday 7 April — Snorkeling the An Thới Archipelago
A speedboat slices south to crystal-clear coves where coral gardens host parrotfish and starfish.  After snorkeling at Hòn Mây Rút and Hòn Thơm, a barbecue lunch of grilled fish and tropical fruit is served on a quiet sandbar before the boat returns.


Day 14 · Tuesday 8 April — Record-Breaking Cable Car and Water Park
The family rides the world-longest over-sea cable car—7.9 km of turquoise panorama—to Hòn Thơm Island.  Hours slip by in Aquatopia Water Park, hurtling down slides or lazing in shaded cabanas, before the gondola carries them back across sunset-pink seas.


Day 15 · Wednesday 9 April — Sao Beach and Night Market
Morning unfolds on the powder-white sands of Sao Beach where turquoise shallows invite snorkeling and paddleboards.  Evening brings Duong Dong Night Market: sizzling calamari skewers, rolled ice-cream cylinders, and stalls of pearl jewelry.


Day 16 · Thursday 10 April — Return Flight to Hanoi
A midday flight lifts off from Phú Quốc and lands two hours later in Hanoi.  The afternoon is spent sipping Hanoi's signature egg-coffee in the historic Giang Café, followed by last-minute silk shopping along Hàng Gai Street.


Day 17 · Friday 11 April — Craft Village & Departure
A leisurely start precedes a short trip to Chuông Village where artisans weave and paint conical hats; each family member decorates a souvenir nón lá.  Back in the city there is rooftop-café downtime before an evening transfer to Nội Bài for the 22:30 overnight flight home.


Day 18 · Saturday 12 April — Arrival in Tel Aviv
The flight lands at dawn, ending the journey with memories of lanterns, karst peaks, coral reefs, and endless bowls of noodles.
