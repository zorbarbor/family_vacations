# Travel Itinerary Website Creation Process

## Overview
This document outlines the complete process for creating beautiful, shareable travel itinerary websites from detailed trip descriptions. The process has been tested and refined with the Vietnam family trip (March 26 - April 12, 2025).

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account with CLI access (`gh` command)
- Basic HTML/CSS knowledge (optional - templates provided)
- Text editor or AI assistant for content creation

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Content Preparation

#### Step 1: Create Detailed Itinerary Text File
- **File**: `detailed_[destination]_itinerary.txt`
- **Content**:
  - Trip context (travelers, dates, transportation overview)
  - Day-by-day detailed descriptions
  - Include specific locations, activities, and experiences
  - Add cultural context and practical details
  - Include photo search guidance at the end

**Example Structure**:
```
Family Trip Context: [overview]
⸻
Day 1 · [Date] — [Location/Theme]
[Detailed narrative description...]

Day 2 · [Date] — [Location/Theme]
[Detailed narrative description...]
[Continue for all days...]

Photo Search Guide:
[Specific search terms for each day's activities]
```

#### Step 2: Source High-Quality Images
- **File**: `[destination]_images.txt`
- **Process**:
  - Search for royalty-free images (Unsplash, official tourism sites)
  - 3-4 images per day minimum
  - Match images to specific activities mentioned in itinerary
  - Organize with clear day-by-day mapping
  - Include backup/alternative image sources

**Format**:
```
DAY X - [Date] — [Theme]
- [Activity description]: [image_url]
- [Activity description]: [image_url]
- [Activity description]: [image_url]
```

### Phase 2: Website Creation

#### Step 3: Generate HTML Itinerary
- **File**: `[destination]_itinerary.html`
- **Features to Include**:
  - Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
  - Beautiful typography and color scheme
  - Day-by-day sections with images
  - Interactive elements (hover effects, smooth scrolling)
  - Print-friendly styles
  - Meta tags for social sharing

**Key HTML Elements**:
- Header with trip title and dates
- Navigation/table of contents
- Day cards with images and descriptions
- Footer with trip summary
- CSS animations and transitions

#### Step 4: Repository Setup
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Create GitHub repository
gh repo create [destination]_trip --public --source=. --remote=origin --push

# Or if repo exists:
git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/[destination]_trip.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with [destination] itinerary"
git push -u origin main
```

### Phase 3: Sharing & Distribution

#### Step 5: Create Shareable Links

**Option A: GitHub Gist (Immediate)**
```bash
gh gist create [destination]_itinerary.html --public --desc "[Destination] Trip Itinerary - [Dates]"
```
- Provides instant shareable link
- Raw HTML link works perfectly in browsers
- Example: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/[user]/[gist-id]/raw/[filename].html`

**Option B: GitHub Pages (Professional)**
- Enable in repository Settings > Pages
- Source: Deploy from branch (main, root)
- URL: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/[destination]_itinerary.html`

**Option C: Alternative Hosting**
- Netlify Drop (drag & drop HTML file)
- Vercel
- GitHub Codespaces preview

## File Structure Template
```
[destination]_trip/
├── detailed_[destination]_itinerary.txt    # Source content
├── [destination]_images.txt                # Image links organized by day
├── [destination]_itinerary.html           # Beautiful website
├── todo.md                                # This process document
└── README.md                              # Repository description
```
